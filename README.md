# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive guide to building a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**. It covers the end-to-end process of designing, implementing, and managing a data warehouse, including **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, **data modeling**, and **analytics integration**. The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** to ensure scalable, efficient, and organized data processing.

Whether you're a data engineer, analyst, or developer, this repository provides a step-by-step approach to creating a robust data warehouse solution.

## Key Features
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline**: From source data ingestion to analytics-ready datasets.
- **ETL Processes**: Efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading workflows.
- **Data Modeling**: Dimensional modeling techniques for optimized query performance.
- **Medallion Architecture**: Structured data layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for scalable and maintainable data pipelines.
- **SQL Server Integration**: Leveraging SQL Server for data storage, processing, and management.
- **Analytics-Ready Data**: Preparing datasets for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Source Data**: Contains sample source data files or scripts to simulate raw data ingestion.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Scripts and workflows for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the data warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Dimensional models, schemas, and SQL scripts for creating tables and relationships.
4. **Medallion Architecture**:
   - **Bronze Layer**: Raw, unprocessed data from source systems.
   - **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, validated, and transformed data.
   - **Gold Layer**: Enriched, aggregated, and analytics-ready data.
5. **Analytics**: Queries, reports, and dashboards for data analysis.
6. **Documentation**: Detailed guides, diagrams, and explanations for each step.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- **SQL Server**: Installed and running.
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: For database management and query execution.
- **ETL Tools**: Optional (e.g., SSIS, Azure Data Factory, or custom scripts).
- **Sample Data**: Provided in the repository or use your own datasets.
